# Netflix-Clone


/* As i improved my swift features, the most important part was the first time I created a complicated app such as this one. In this app, I improved the programmatically coding. Although I had some hard times solving problems, it was really worth the time. It helped me to understand Restful API very well. */

I created a netflix clone app.

You can check top trend, upcoming tv shows and movies, search the movies as well.

I used MVVM design pattern.

I created programmatically(No storyboard)

I'm leaving below some images of the application.![Simulator Screen Shot - iPhone 14 Pro Max - 2022-09-18 at 11 06 51](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76867730/190914224-5ca615ea-0c3c-4dba-bc29-29320f9eea98.png)
